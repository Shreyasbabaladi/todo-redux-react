Task:  
- Create a Todo app using React.js. 
- You can use your own creativity for the look and feel.
- Must have the functionality to Create, Edit, and Delete Tasks and filter them by Active/Completed/All.


Guideline:
 - Must have used one functional component with Hooks and one class component with Life cycle methods.
 - Must have used Redux for global state management.
 - Bonus points for organized folder structure.
 - Bonus points for persisting the data on reload.
 - Bonus points for using Next.js.
 - Bonus points for mobile responsiveness.
